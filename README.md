# WorkDayScheduler

## User Story
As an employee with a busy schedule I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given I am using a daily planner to create a schedule when I open the planner then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When I scroll down then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours. When I view the timeblocks for the daay, then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When I click into a timeblock, then I can enter an event. When I click the save button for that timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in the local storage. When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist.
